These are my dotfiles - the .<whatever> files that live in my home directory.
As you may notice, they aren't actually dotfiles - they don't have a dot in
front! To do this, I created ~/.dotfiles/ and symlinked everything into
there: ~/.vim is a symlink to ~/.dotfiles/vim/, and so on.
If you'd like to use this in your own config, you may want to use a little
shell script I wrote for auto-symlinking, available in
"the util file":http://github.com/gabebw/dotfiles/blob/master/extra/util.
