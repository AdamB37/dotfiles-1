# `brew doctor` recommendations
# Consider editing your .bashrc to put:
#  /usr/local/bin
#ahead of /usr/bin in your $PATH.
PATH="$(brew --prefix)"/bin:$PATH
# Put /usr/local/sbin in PATH
PATH="$(brew --prefix)"/sbin:$PATH

# If you install Python packages via pip, binaries will be installed under
# Python's cellar but not automatically linked into the Homebrew prefix.
# You may want to add Python's bin folder to your PATH as well:
# /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7/bin
PATH="$(brew --prefix python)"/bin:$PATH
